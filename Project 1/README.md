* search.py contains the solutions for the first 4 questions and searchAgents.py for the remaining 4.
* In questions 1 through 4, I have gone a different route for founding the constructed path that you may have seen others have taken. I use a dictionary called `connections` that stores `(Current State : (Previous State, Direction from Previous to Current State))` pairs. This allows me to construct the path by backtracking from the goal state to the start state.
* Traditionally, I have used a visited set to keep track of explored nodes in the DFS and BFS algorithms. However, on the UCS and A* algorithms, I switched the set for a second additional dictionary called `costs` that is used to keep track both of the explored nodes and the currently cheapest cost to get to that node. This allows me to avoid having to check if a node is in the set and then checking if the cost to get to that node is cheaper than the current cost.
* To find all the corners in question 6, I have used a heuristic that prioritizes states based on their distance from the furthest alive corner. One can show with a bit of math that the heuristic is both admissible and consistent. Even though this heuristic is not the most efficient, it is still good enough to pass the autograder with a perfect score. The best heuristic that I have found upon researching is one that sums the distances from the state to the closest corner and then that corner to the next closest corner and so on.
* Similarly, in question 7, I have used a similar techinic by switching the Manhattan distance for the Maze distance between the state and the furthest corner. This heuristic is also admissible and consistent. Even though I haven't tested it, you could again use the "snaking" method described above and it would probably even work with just the Manhattan distance.
