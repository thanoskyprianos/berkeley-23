# Introductory Project

This is an introductory project, so nothing needs an explanation. It's a simple project to help you get started with coding and familiarize yourself with the basics of Python.

# Notes
The try except block in `buyLotsOfFruit.py` follows the "EAFP" (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) idiom. You can change it to an if statement if you don't like it.
